Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd in Python
Given an integer input the objective is to write a Python code to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd. To do so the main idea is to divide the number by 2 and check if it’s divisible or not. It’s an Even number is it’s perfectly divisible by 2 or an Odd number otherwise.
